//Q:20 Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, 
// rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. 
// Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

const Countries: string[] =["London","UAE","Saudi arab","Paris"];

console.log("\nlist of Countries:");
for(let a =0; a < Countries.length; a++){
console.log (Countries[a]);
